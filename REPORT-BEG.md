# 📄 IncomeInsight – Project Report - 🟢 **Beginner Track**

Welcome to your personal project report!  
Use this file to answer the key reflection questions for each phase of the project. This report is designed to help you think like a data scientist, guide AI tools more effectively, and prepare for real-world job interviews.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> Answer the EDA questions provided in the project materials here. Focus on data quality, trends, anomalies, and relationships.

### 🔑 Question 1: What features show the strongest correlation with earning >$50K?
✅ Answer 1: Education, Age and Hours per week


### 🔑 Question 2: How does income vary with education, marital status, or hours worked per week?

### 🔑 Question 3: Are there disparities across race, sex, or native country?

### 🔑 Question 4: Do capital gains/losses strongly impact the income label?

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Model Development

> This phase spans 3 weeks. Answer each set of questions weekly as you build, train, evaluate, and improve your models.

### 🔍 Week 1: Laying the Foundation

#### 🔑 Question 1:
**Which features in the dataset appear to have the strongest relationship with the income label (>50K), and how did you determine this?**  
🎯 *Purpose: Tests ability to identify influential predictors through EDA.*

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `.groupby('income')` to compare mean values of numeric features.  
Use bar plots or violin plots for categorical features vs. income.  
Check chi-squared test or information gain if desired.

#### 🔑 Question 2:
**Did you engineer any new features from existing ones? If so, explain the new feature(s) and why you think they might help your classifier.**  
🎯 *Purpose: Tests creativity and business-driven reasoning in feature creation.*

💡 **Hint:**  
Consider grouping `education_num` into bins, creating a `has_capital_gain` flag, or interaction terms like `hours_per_week * education_num`.

---

#### 🔑 Question 3:
**Which continuous features required scaling or transformation before modeling, and which method did you use?**  
🎯 *Purpose: Connects feature scaling to model compatibility.*

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `df.describe()` and `hist()` to evaluate spread.  
Logistic Regression is sensitive to feature scale; Random Forest is not.  
Apply `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` accordingly.

#### 🔑 Question 4:
**Is the target variable (`income`) imbalanced? How did you check, and what will you do (if anything) to handle it?**  
🎯 *Purpose: Tests understanding of classification imbalances and impact on metrics.*

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `.value_counts(normalize=True)`.  
If imbalance exists, consider using class weights, SMOTE, or stratified splits.  
Mention implications for precision, recall, and F1.

#### 🔑 Question 5:
**What does your final cleaned dataset look like before modeling? Include shape, types of features (numerical/categorical), and a summary of the preprocessing steps applied.**  
🎯 *Purpose: Encourages documentation and preparation for modeling.*

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `df.shape`, `df.dtypes`, and summarize what was dropped, encoded, scaled, or engineered.
