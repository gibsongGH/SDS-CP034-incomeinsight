# Adult Income Classification - Machine Learning Model Results

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of training and comparing three machine learning models for predicting income levels (>$50K vs ≤$50K) using the Adult Census dataset. The models evaluated were:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **XGBoost**

## Dataset Overview

- **Total samples**: 32,561 individuals
- **Features**: 69 (after preprocessing)
- **Training set**: 26,048 samples (80%)
- **Test set**: 6,513 samples (20%)
- **Class distribution**: Imbalanced (76% ≤$50K, 24% >$50K)

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Missing value handling**: Replaced '?' entries with mode values
2. **Feature engineering**: Created binary features for capital gains/losses presence
3. **Categorical encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
4. **Numerical scaling**: StandardScaler for continuous variables
5. **Feature selection**: Country grouping to reduce dimensionality
